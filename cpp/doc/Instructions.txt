To run simulation through Visual Studio 2019 IDE,

1) Open visual studio 2019 and open VCProject\SDR.sln
2) Open SDR project properties and replace 2017a with 2019b (your version of MATLAB)
3) Press Alt+F7 to open project properties again, goto Debugging and enter $(SolutionDir)in_data\sample_nottochange_ch1_fileN_0.bin in Command Arguments.
4) To feed a different file to Visual Studio SDR project, change file name in Debugging -> Command Arguments
5) Simulation will run and print execution times of acquisition part and tracking part.
6) Simulation will run and also compare current outputted results with pre-generated MATLAB results and print if each element of array is exactly equal to MATLAB's counterpart.

To run simulation if you want to run executable directly from commandline,

1) open command prompt
2) to VCProject
3) issue command ".\x64\Debug\SDR.exe" ".\in_data\sample_nottochange_ch1_fileN_0.bin"
